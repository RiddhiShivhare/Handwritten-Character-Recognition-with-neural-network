# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-with-neural-network
Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is the detection of handwritten English Characters that is English alphabets from A-Z. 
Here I have made a model that takes in an image of a handwritten English character as an input , performs operation on it and then classifies the character written on it.
This project is based on Computer Vision , Deep learning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
OCR is a part of computer vision that transforms a two-dimensional image of text that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine â€“ readable text. It has a wide range of applications such as Data entry for business documents , traffic sign recognition etc. The OCR can be implemented by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a popular deep neural network architecture.
